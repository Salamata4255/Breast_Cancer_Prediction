### Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning Models

# Goals
- Predict Breast Cancer using 3 ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN) 
- Predict whether the breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign
- Compare models based on accuracy test, ROC values, and Confusion matrix

# Data
<br>https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data </br>

# Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Numpy libraries>

# Steps 
- Data Visualization: graphed data to see patterns
- Data Analysis: studied data neatly
- Data Cleaning: removed useless features
- ML models: Applied the models one by one
- Train models
- Compare test accuracy
